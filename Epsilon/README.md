The application receives two arguments: "path/to/src" and "path/to/gen" and injects the classes in the src and saves them in the gen folder.
Idealy the src and gen folders should be different or the classes would be overriten and the annotations ost.

Example:
java -jar J2JInjection.jar /src/to/path /src/to/gen
